Using a simple Job listing app, we'll learn how to use the most powerful E2E Web Testing framework for modern web applications - Cypress!

## Installing dependencies
You can run
```$ npm i```
from root folder, or navigate to each project and install dependencies from there:

```
$ cd client && npm i
$ cd ../api && npm i
```

## How to run application
To run application, you need to open two terminals and run
```npm start```
inside each project

## How to run Cypress
**While the application is running, inside the `client` project,** run
```npm run cypress:open```
to open the test runner, or
```npm run cypress``` 
to run headlessly and report in the console.
